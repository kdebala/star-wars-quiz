## This is my boilerplate/Generator/Starter Project

This is the first time I have done Webpack configuration all by myself.

## Features

- eslint
- prettier
- sass
- typescript
- webpack

- webpack-dev-server -> live server
- html-webpack-plugin -> gets template html, adds css and js to html and put output html to dist
- mini-css-extract-plugin -> extracts CSS into separate files for production build

## How to start

- git clone https://github.com/kdebala/boilerplate
- cd boilerplate
- npm install
- npm start
